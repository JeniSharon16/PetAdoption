  <p >Pet adoption is the process of transferring responsibility for a pet that was previously owned by another party. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters, rescue groups, or other pet owners. Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model wherein the organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care
    Online pet adoption sites have databases, searchable by the public, of pets being housed by thousands of animal shelters and rescue groups Before adoption
    Animals are placed up for adoption for numerous reasons like being abandoned, lost, or rehomed from their current family. The need for rehoming sometimes results from allergies, death of a pet-owner, divorce, the birth of a baby, or relocation. Additionally, adoption mayweather, and traffic and enter adoption shelters in need of medical attention before entering the adoption process. After medical examinations, treatments, and behavioral tests, adoption centers (at their discretion) determine if the pet is healthy enough for adoption.[citation needed]</p>
